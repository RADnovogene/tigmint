TIGMINT-LIFTOVER-ARCS PIPELINE

Prior to running pipeline: 
	export PATH=<path-to-liftover+tigmint>:$PATH
		(aka the path to wherever this README is)
	export PATH=<path-to-correct-ARCS-version>:$PATH

Main pipeline steps: 
	1. Run Tigmint
		- produces BWA *.sortbx.bam file, *.breaktigs.fa, and *.breaktigs.fa.bed files
	2. Liftover
		- produces liftover *_cliftover.bam.sortn.bam file
	3. ARCS+LINKS
		- produces final rescaffolded fasta

How to run: 
	- Run full pipeline with the following command on draft <myassembly>.fa and <myreads>.fq.gz
		
		tigmint-liftover-arcs-make all draft=<myassembly> reads=<myreads>

		- file extensions for assembly and for reads must be .fa and .fq.gz respectively. 

Dry run: 
	- To print out all the commands that will be run, add -n on commandline.

NOTES: 
	- Use the *develop* version of ARCS until further notice
